Revision history for Net-WebSocket-Server

0.4.0   2021-03-14
        Support for max_recv_size. Support for doing TLS handshake during server
        loop by handling IO::Socket::SSL objects with SSL_startHandshake => 0,
        preventing blocking during TLS accept(). shutdown() now exits main loop
        without waiting for remaining clients. ip() and port() now return useful
        values after socket disconnects. Listening TCP socket more thoroughly
        cleaned up during shutdown().

0.3.4   2016-01-27
